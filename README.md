Handwritten digit recognition is an very important aspect of computer vision, and it is widely used in our world. For machine learning methods, I choose knn, neural network, SVM,  MLE, Naive Bayes, and Bayesian Network. For dealing with data, I use two methods. One is freeman code. It is using outline of the digit as the features. Then I use 4-connected freeman code and 8-connected freeman code. The other method is to cut the image so that the digit is close enough to the boundary and then resize to change the size to n*n and update the pixel value to 0 and 1.
